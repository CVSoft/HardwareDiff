Identifies differences in TI calculator processors  
Poorly written by CVSoft

## Description
This program uses the behavior of the two undocumented Z80 flags to differentiate the many different types of Z80 processors found in TI graphing calculators -- these routines were provided by jacobly. In addition, it also checks to see if a Z180 is present.

## Assembling
All of these are assembled using benryves' [Brass](http://www.benryves.com/products/brass) assembler. These use either the Ultimate TI-8x Include Files written by BrandonW or the include files packaged with assembly shells. Neither are particularly hard to locate.
